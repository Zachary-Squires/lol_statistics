# lol_statistics

Repository to hold things related to my League of Legends statistical analysis project, in which I used Riot Games' API and my own Python program though Jupyter Notebooks to get my match history and move it into a SQL database. I then attached the database to tableau and created a dashboard to visualize my match history and allow me to use the data to improve my gameplay.
