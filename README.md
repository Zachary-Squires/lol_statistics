# lol_statistics

Repository to hold things related to my League of Legends statistical analysis project, in which I used Riot Games' API and my own Python program though Jupyter Notebooks to get my match history and move it into a SQL database. I then attached the database to tableau and created a dashboard to visualize my match history and allow me to use the data to improve my gameplay. 

My Jupyter notebook is included largely to show the process, a working API key will obviously not be included so it won't function unless the user went to this link (https://developer.riotgames.com/) and generated their own. Also included is the lol_table from my MySQL database in CSV form. 

Link to my dashboard on Tableau Public:
